# Postman API MCP Server

**This project offers two MCP-compatible server options:**

1. **Streamable HTTP server** ‚Äî A fully MCP-compliant server entrypoint (`dist/src/index.js`) using the [Streamable HTTP transport](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/specification/2025-03-26/basic/transports#streamable-http).
2. **STDIO server** ‚Äî A lightweight MCP server that communicates over standard input/output, ideal for integration with editors and tools like [VS‚ÄØCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

See more about the Model Context Protocol available transports in the [MCP specification](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/docs/concepts/transports).

## üß∞ VS Code Integration

You can integrate your MCP server with Visual Studio Code to use it with VS Code extensions that support MCP.

1. Create a `.vscode/mcp.json` file in your project with the following configuration:

    ```json
    {
      "servers": {
        "postman-api-mcp": {
          "type": "stdio",
          "command": "node",
          "args": [
            "${workspaceFolder}/dist/src/index.js"
          ],
          "env": {
            "POSTMAN_API_KEY": "${input:postman-api-key}"
          }
        },
        "postman-api-http-server": {
          "type": "sse",
          "url": "http://localhost:1337/sse",
          "env": {
            "POSTMAN_API_KEY": "${input:postman-api-key}"
          }
        }
      },
      "inputs": [
        {
          "id": "postman-api-key",
          "type": "promptString",
          "description": "Enter your Postman API key"
        }
      ]
    }
    ```

2. Install an MCP-compatible VS Code extension (such as GitHub Copilot, Claude for VS Code, or other AI assistants that support MCP).

3. Configure your extension to use one of the MCP servers:

   - **postman-api-mcp**: Uses the local stdio-based server, running directly from your project files
   - **postman-api-http-server**: Connects to the Postman cloud MCP server via [Streamable HTTP](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/typescript-sdk?tab=readme-ov-file#streamable-http) at the /mcp endpoint

4. When prompted, enter your Postman API key.

You can now use your Postman API tools with your VS Code extension through the MCP protocol.
